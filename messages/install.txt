SublimeText Transparent
=======================

Overview
--------
This simple plugin for Sublime Text 2 and Sublime Text 3/4 provides contextual menues to modify the application's opacity.

Requirements:
- Windows: SetSublimeLayered.exe in lib directory in the package
  That's required since changing Sublime Text's windows to layered mode from within the extension itself
  hangs the editor, maybe a Python embedded bug.
  Notice: The source code of it is in a simple very tiny assembly that compiles with FlatAssembler, but some AV shows as False Positive,
  which is weird for a really tiny executable (1024 bytes) ðŸ˜…
- Linux: It relies on `wmctrl` and `xprop`, the first to get the sublime_text.Sublime_text class instances (Windows), 
	and the second one, to set the opacity level of the matching Sublime Text's windows.
- macOS: Unsupported.

Usage:
-------
There are three methods to set transparency:

1. Visit `View > Window's Transparency` submenu to set the opacity
2. You can use the hotkeys `Ctrl+Shift+[1,2,3,4,5,6]`
3. Or you can right click and use the contextual menu


Configuration:
--------------
To set custom transparency levels visit `Preferences > Package Settings > SublimeTextTrans > Settings - User`, it will open the user's custom preferences file for this plugin.

There you can modify the transparency levels, by adding the following and adjusting the levels as you wish:

{

	// If you like to have a different transparency level
	// modify this array of options in your user preferences
	// i.e. just add (copy/paste) this array and modify at wish
	// IMPORTANT: Level of opacity varies from 0 to 255
	// 0 = Totally transparent, 255 = Fully opaque
	// ORDER is important, it has its correspondent menu item/hotkey
	"levels": [
		255, // Full opaque i.e not transparent - a.k.a Disabled, recommended to leave it as 255 [Ctrl+Shift+1]
		212, // Level 5 - [Ctrl+Shift+6]
		220, // Level 4 - [Ctrl+Shift+5]
		228, // Level 3 - [Ctrl+Shift+4]
		236, // Level 2 - [Ctrl+Shift+3]
		243  // Level 1 - [Ctrl+Shift+2]
	]
}

You can enable or disable autoapply transparency on ST load automatically by adding to the user settings:
{
	"autoapply": true // false to disable
}

Or just open default settings, copy it and paste it in your user settings, modifiy as you wish and save your new settings.
